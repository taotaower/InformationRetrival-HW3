1) I get 103657 terms in the corpus, so I decide to set 0,001 of them to be as stop words.

2) get the intersection of list of term that has top-100 TermFreq and list of term that has top-100 DocFreq as the part of
as the part of stop words, and combine them with top10-DocFreq terms.
since top words will have both high TermFreq and DocFreq, so I decide to choose intersection, and some words like top10-DocFreq terms
nearly in every docs, so I decide to set them as stopwords too

as we can see from the stopwords list, most of them are functional words, "wikipedia" is in there because it is in every
document's title
