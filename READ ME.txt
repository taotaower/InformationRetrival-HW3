To run these code, you need to make sure your python version is 2.7.10

1. for running task1.py u need to install these libraries :  os , re , io , bs4 , py2casefold

the design and strategy for this task is :

1) Check the DOM and use "beautiful soup" to remove some useless contents
2) after get the text of the article, split it into single words list, remove punctuation except ',' , '.' and '-'
3) use regular expression to remove ',' , '.' and '-' in some words.
4) combine cleaned list into article and output

2. for running task2.py u need to install these libraries :  os , re , json

the design and strategy for this task is :

1) for getting n-gram inverted lists, I choose to use two layer dictionary data structure, the outer layer's key is
word and value is dictionary of {documentID : termFrequency}, the inner layer's key is documentID, value is termFrequency
e.g. { 'the' : {id1 : freq1, id2:freq2 ,...} 'a' : {id1 : freq1, id2:freq2 ,...} }
2) use dictionary structure to store the number of tokens in each document
3) keep these two kind of dictionary in JSON file type, for convenient read back

3. for running task3.py u need to install these libraries :  io , prettytable , json

the design and strategy for this task is :
1) read JSON files back , count and output termFreq and docFreq

---for running task-3-stopword.py u need to install these libraries :  json , io

the design and strategy for this task is :

1) read JSON files back , get the list of term that has top-100 TermFreq and get the list of term that has top-100 DocFreq
2) get the intersection of list of term that has top-100 TermFreq and list of term that has top-100 DocFreq
3) the intersection combines top10-DocFreq terms will be the stoplist

## explanation for stoplist in another txt file

4. for running zipf.py u need to install these libraries :  __future__ , pylab, collections, json

to draw "Zipf plot for 1-gram ", u need to open and read json file 'task2/1-gram.json'
to draw "Zipf plot for 2-gram ", u need to open and read json file 'task2/2-gram.json'
to draw "Zipf plot for 3-gram ", u need to open and read json file 'task2/3-gram.json'
you can change the title of the graph in title("Zipf plot for 1-gram ")



=========================================================================================================

You can run any python file in the submitted folder by using command line "python theNameOfTheFile.py"

like run 'webCrawler HW1.py', u type "python webCrawler HW1.py"

To make sure u get the exactly the required result of the tasks in the output txt-files, u can rename

or remove the submitted files,

or you can change the output files' name in the code line "f = open("theNameOfTheFile.txt", "a")"

or clean the contents in them, before you run the python file, otherwise you will get duplicate result than expected,

thank you.
